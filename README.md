## QRNG-Analysis
This repo analyzes the randomness of a thermal light source which exhibits photon bunching (Amplified Spontaneous Emission). 

The data seems to be truly random and doesnt resemble any semantic structures such as (programming)-languages. 

Nonetheless it would be interesting to analyze the randomness of the double slit experiment (order of slit 1/2 on arrival) to maybe find some semantic structure.

Maybe encryption can be seen at double slit with (or without) measurement

There are no real waves when shooting an electron. The interference pattern is just a map where one electron could end up in based on propability. Even tho an electron is a particel all the time and never a wave on its own, sending many results in an interference pattern. My theory is that without a supervisor an electron passes through the central divider. While passing the direction is changend due to collision, somehow resulting in an interference pattern. With a supervisor, the edges get "hard" and the electron cant pass the divider therefore behaving like particles. This means the edges of subject matter would be passable without a supervisor. 

#### The theory aligns with these phenomenons:


| Scenario / Change | Without Observer (Wave Behavior) | With Observer (Particle Behavior) | Physics Principle (The "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single Slit** | **Diffraction Pattern:** A central bright spot with faint side fringes. | **Single Cluster:** A single pile of hits directly behind the slit. | The wave/particle is deflected by the slit edges (Diffraction). |
| **Double Slit** | **Interference Pattern:** Many fine, alternating light and dark stripes. | **Two Clusters:** One pile of hits behind each of the two slits. | **Superposition:** Without observation, paths overlap; with observation, they don't. |
| **Making Slit Narrower** | The pattern becomes **wider** and more spread out. | The cluster becomes **wider** (stronger scattering). | **Heisenberg:** Precise position $\Delta x$ $\rightarrow$ stronger lateral "kick" $\Delta p$. |
| **Making Slit Wider** | The pattern becomes **narrower** and sharper. | The cluster becomes **narrower** (less scattering). | **Heisenberg:** Vague position $\Delta x$ $\rightarrow$ particle maintains its original direction. |
| **Increasing Slit Distance** | Interference fringes move **closer together** (finer stripes). | The two clusters move **further apart**. | **Geometry:** The physical sources of the waves/particles are further apart. |

#### Theory doesnt hold against ??:
- A random collision at the divider would result in a uniform distribution not an interference pattern.
- The screen measurement behind the slits should be higher than in the middle.
- Why should only the edges be passable? A subject matter without any slit cant be passed with or without a supervisor.
